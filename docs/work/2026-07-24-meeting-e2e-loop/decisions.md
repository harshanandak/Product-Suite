# Decisions log — meeting → board end-to-end loop

The `/dev` decisions log for [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md). One entry per spec gap or
deviation, recorded at the moment the choice was made.

## D1 — Migration number shifted from `0016` to `0015` (Task B.1)

**Context.** `tasks.md` assigns `0015_meeting_schema.sql` to Task A.1 and
`0016_meeting_promotions.sql` to Task B.1. B.1 is explicitly *parallel with* A.1
and was implemented first; A.1 is not built.

**Decision.** B.1 takes the next free number: `packages/db/migrations/0015_meeting_promotions.sql`,
journal `idx: 15`. A.1's meeting-schema migration takes `0016` when it lands.

**Why.** Drizzle's journal must be a contiguous `0..N` sequence — `check-migration-parity.mjs`
fails on a gap. Reserving `0015` for an unwritten migration would leave the journal
non-contiguous and the parity gate red until A.1 lands. Migration numbers are ordering,
not identity; the two migrations are independent, so either order applies cleanly.

**Consequence for A.1.** Author the meeting schema as `0016_meeting_schema.sql`, `idx: 16`.

## D2 — No regenerated snapshot chain for `0015` (Task B.1)

**Context.** `tasks.md` says the migration comes "+ journal/snapshot", and the plan
warns the snapshot chain must be regenerated from a clean primary checkout because a
worktree cannot resolve `drizzle-orm`.

**Decision.** The migration SQL and the journal entry are hand-authored; **no**
`meta/00NN_snapshot.json` was added.

**Why.** `packages/db/migrations/meta/` holds snapshots for `0000`–`0011` only.
`0012`, `0013` and `0014` each shipped hand-authored SQL + a journal entry and no
snapshot — their headers say so explicitly ("Hand-authored (drizzle-kit generate
unavailable in the worktree)"). The snapshot chain is already ungated and stale;
`scripts/check-migration-parity.mjs` compares the journal against the `.sql` files
and does not read snapshots at all. Adding a lone `0015` snapshot on top of a chain
that stops at `0011` would be a fabricated link, not a regenerated chain.

**Filed as follow-up, not fixed here.** Regenerating `0012`–`0015` from a clean
primary checkout is a repo-wide chore outside this task's payload.

**Verification.** `bun run check:migration-parity` passes; `bun run --cwd packages/db test`
(12 tests) and `typecheck` pass.

## D3 — `packages/db` has no ESLint config (observed, not changed)

`bun run --cwd packages/db lint` fails with "ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.js
file" on an unmodified checkout — a pre-existing gap, and the reason `verify:db` is
`typecheck && test` with no lint step. Not touched: fixing it is unrelated to this
plan and would be scope creep.
